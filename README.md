## HackerRank Mock Interview Experience & Feedback

I recently completed a HackerRank mock interview focused on algorithm optimization and TypeScript proficiency. It was a valuable learning experience that helped me enhance my problem-solving skills and understand the importance of writing efficient code.

### Overall Rating: 3/5

### Feedback Highlights:

**Code Quality (3/5):**  
- Demonstrated decent understanding of TypeScript with progress in optimization.  
- Started with a basic slicing approach and improved towards character comparisons.  
- Areas to improve: more descriptive variable names, detailed comments, and better error handling.

**Problem Solving (3/5):**  
- Quick understanding of requirements and iterative optimization attempts.  
- Could improve by analyzing time complexity earlier and considering edge cases more thoroughly.

**Language Proficiency (4/5):**  
- Good use of TypeScript types, arrays, and control structures.  
- Next steps: use advanced TypeScript features and implement more robust error handling.

**Technical Communication (2/5):**  
- Need to be more proactive in explaining thought process, discussing trade-offs, and asking clarifying questions.
